## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Monitor Backend**: The backend container is restarting - may need investigation
2. **Set Up Monitoring**: Consider monitoring certificate expiry
3. **Backup Certificates**: Consider backing up SSL certificates
4. **Team Documentation**: Share SSL setup with team members

## Maintenance

### Check Certificate Status
```bash
openssl s_client -connect apieyeamembership.eyea.et:443 -servername apieyeamembership.eyea.et < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates
```

### Manual Certificate Renewal
